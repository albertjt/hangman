### Project Description 
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Within a class, following attribute initialisation, the check_guess method is defined. This checks if the guessed letter is indeed in the word randomly selected by the computer. If so, it adds it to the word_guessed variable; if not, you lose a life and try again.
The ask_for_input method takes in the letter guess, ensures it is a single alphabetic character, and passes it into the check_guess method.
